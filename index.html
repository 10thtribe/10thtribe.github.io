                <article>
                    A little after high noon, Dany Pen and I tuck away to Maria’s Ristorante, Chancery Lane’s discreet, cobblestone meeting place for politicians and businessmen. We are neither. Cambodian, Canadian, “hood” Ms. Pen is all of these things. She is full, red lips and a leopard skin sweater, huge gold hoops and fine art. Dany has taken a break from her job coordinating the National Gallery’s youth education program to talk with me about how she has come to be an expat, an immigrant, and an artist; how she came to create art that through merges her personal histories of genocide, poverty, and displacement.<br><br><p>Meet Dany Pen: artist.</p><br><!--bug: FIX + hyperlink-->
                    Meet the stark,photographic installations of her family and other Cambodian 
                    Khmer Rouge survivors that won her a place in Bermuda’s 2012 Biennale.  Find out why she creates art that acts as umbilical cords to her community and family, always questioning what it takes to maintain – or even achieve – a sense of self amidst disconnection...

                <article> I grew up under the awning of my mother's literary sensibility. In our house, bookshelves sagged, exhausted from holding up collections of poetry and English classics, psychology texts, dictionaries and encyclopedias.  Despite (+ because of!) the technological zeitgeist, I continue to read:
                    <ul class="a">
                      <li>for communion with wise, sentient thinkers across time, space, + ideological borders</li> 
                      <li>to explore the human condition, or to 'travel' to different locales, communities + cultures </li>
                      <li>for guidance on how to live my life</li>
                      <li>to have a repose from our fast-paced, soulless, and stressful culture</li> 
                      My reading reflects these aims. <a href="reading.html">Book summaries, reviews, and reflections here.</a>

              <article> My mother's first career was as a mental health nurse; later she became the 
                Director of the National Drug Commission.  Some of my earlier memories are of her studies, and the heavy tomes on psychology and cognitive science scattered about the apartment. I was still in elementary school when, amidst Luft and Ingham and Abraham Malsow, I encountered my first favorite word...self-actualization.  This concept became a lighthouse.  In pursuit of this ideal, I think + read a lot about education: autodidactism, informal + formal, holistic + academic. <a href="learning.html">Stray thoughts here.</a>

            <article><strong>How to Make a Genre...</strong></article><br>
            <article>Pinning down an exact history for an underground movement is difficult. At times the 
                    project has been referred to as “Gombase” or “Gombass,” depending on whether you speak to one producer or the other, and when. An ad by local tourism campaign #morepinkBermuda featured Gumbase, the innovative genre by producers Derek Simmons and DJ Jussa Jus (aka Kofi/Justin Whitter). Through Gumbase, our celebrated drum rhythms cross-over from being an occasional street-based sonic treat to a year round, indoor, multi mood, multi purpose genre, making Gumbase a musical/cultural project worth listening to.
            </article><br>
            <article>“It wasn’t about just doing one track each," Simmons says. "It’s about creating a 
                    movement, so people can be inspired to embrace Bermudian culture with new age music. There are not many people embracing Bermudian culture in music. It’s people embracing other cultures, or what [they] see on TV."
