# 10thtribe.github.io
First ever web project, a personal portfolio site of my work.  All content is mine unless otherwise noted.  Proud graduate of Code First Girls, University of Warwick, Spring 2017.
This work-in-progress will be updated over time with new content, increased interactivity, and better viewing across devices as I gain new skills.
